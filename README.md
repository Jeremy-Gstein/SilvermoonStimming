# Usage:
- While in silvermoon the addon is loaded and pops up on the screen (drag the menu and its new position is saved)
- If you close the menu use `/silvermoon toggle` to re-open (this will also open the menu if you are outside silvermoon)
- Total laps are tracked across all characters. To reset progress manually run `/silvermoon reset`
- for list of all usable commands `/silvermoon`

**Work-in-Progress expect breaking changes!!**
